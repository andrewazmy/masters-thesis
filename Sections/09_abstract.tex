This thesis discusses two different approaches for vision-based autonomous systems for a self-driving car; the Mediated Perception approach that extracts features and creates a unified environment perception based on which a driving action is made, and the Behavior Reflex approach that directly reacts to an observed image with a relevant driving action. Lane and vehicle perception techniques using computer vision and deep neural networks are discussed and evaluated. PID and MPC controllers are implemented and tested in a simulation environment with the difference in performance highlighted. End-to-End imitation learning is investigated and implemented. Additionally, an integration between control theory for data collection and imitation learning is proposed, yielding satisfactory results. Internal layers of a deep convolution neural network is visualized, providing an understanding of how a neural network can correctly predict a vehicle's steering angle. Limitations of imitation learning are discussed, with conditional imitation learning as a proposed solution.
